When the program is run, enter the following: BSCC, WAC, GUEST, BSCC_EMPLOYEE, or WAC_EMPLOYEE.
Keep the caps.

WAC has a special unguessable password
BSCC has a publicly visible password
and the guest account has no password
and both employee accounts have no password

This is my first C# attempt so don't criticize
